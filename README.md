# PredictiveAnalysis-NonlinearRegression
This is a project that is centered around predictive analyses - nonlinear regression, specifically quadratic and interactive models. 
The intended use of this file is to provide exhibitive materials as proof of skills competency in excel, mathematics & statistics as well as industry (non-specific) analytical techniques. 
This dataset has multiple variables relating to the marketing industry. Details are below:

 Problem: A company's marketing campaigns initially drive higher returns (revenue), but after reaching a saturation point, additional spend generates diminishing returns or even negative ROI. 
 This model can help determine the optimal level of marketing spend for maximizing revenue as well as avoid overspending on ineffective campaigns.		

Requirements: Create a Scatterplot (with the trendline, and equation), Setup the data for the Regression model (Quadratic setup), 
Use the Data Analysis Toolpak to run the basic Regression (do not need all the checkboxes as you saw in the video) using the setup created for the 
Quadratic model--on the regression output, the only action is at the top as the demo had it, write the equation for the model.									

Final outputs: 3 sheets (one for the raw data here; one sheet that copies the data and adds the necessary information for the model; 
and the final sheet will have the regerssion output with your type equation response).
